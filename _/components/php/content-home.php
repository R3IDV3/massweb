		While body mass is a critically important life history trait that covaries and scales with a suite of other variables, it is surprisingly difficult to find verified data outside a few well-studied, charismatic groups. 
		MassBase aims to collate reliable body mass data across the whole spectrum of animal life, from snails to whales, lice to mice.

		<h3>Large and diverse specimen archive</h3>
		<p>The large and diverse specimen archive at BIO allow us access to a huge data source for a variety of research interests. As biodiversity scientists, we are striving to maximize the useful information that can be extracted from each specimen and species in our collection, using our available resources. </p>

		<h3>When body mass matters</h3>
		<p>Body mass is arguably the most critical variable one can measure for biodiversity, as the number of ecological, physiological, and evolutionary characteristics it covaries with, scales by, or predicts are immense (<a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Ecological_Implications_of_Body_Size.html?id=OYVxiZgTXWsC" target="_blank">Peters 1983;</a> <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Scaling.html?id=8WkjD3L_avQC&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Schmidt-Neilsen 1984;</a> <a href="http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2097086?uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21104632676863" target="_blank">LaBarbera 1989;</a> <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Size_Function_and_Life_History.html?id=-iBS6-2OO3wC&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Calder 1996</a>). A massive variance in body mass exists across the Animal Kingdom (at least 15 orders of magnitude), and even between and within closely related species, so explaining the origin and maintenance of this variation is a critical objective of biodiversity science.</p>
